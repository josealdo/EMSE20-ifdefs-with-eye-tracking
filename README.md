## Overview
The C preprocessor is widely used in practice. Conditional compilation with #ifdef annotations allows developers to introduce variability in their programs. In practice, developers use disciplined annotations, entirely enclosing full statements with preprocessor directives, and undisciplined ones, enclosing only parts of the statements. However, there is no consensus on whether a developer should use disciplined annotations. While one study found undisciplined annotations more time-consuming and error-prone, another study found no difference between disciplined and undisciplined regarding task completion time and accuracy. In this article, we evaluate whether three fine-grained refactorings to discipline #ifdef annotations affect code comprehension and visual attention with an eye tracker. We conduct a controlled experiment with 64 human subjects novices in C programming language. We observed statistically significant differences in favor of applying two refactorings to discipline annotations with respect to the analyzed metrics (time, fixation duration, and fixation count) in the area of the code tasks changed by each refactoring. Based on previous studies, these results can be associated with an impact on code comprehension and visual attention.
